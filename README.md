# calculatorGUI
Created a calculator with a GUI. 

This is my frist ever time making a GUI in any language. Spent basically a couple hours messing around with tkinter trying to make this. Wasn't super difficult. The only thing that was a problem was positioning all the buttons, texts box, etc...

I just made the calculators numbers match the numpad on my keyboard.
